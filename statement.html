  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>I am an up and coming video artist. I thrive to create the best visually appealing images for movies I create with me and my friends. Some say it is difficult to work in the VFX world but I find it challenging. Having many tools at my disposal such as my friends, I have the ability to put my thoughts into pieces of art. I view myself as someone who wants to make their own dreams become a reality, however I wish I had someone to kick me in the back to help me stay motivated to do so. With every piece I create, I put my all into it. It is my goal to make people smile or say How did you do that?". I want to be the person who helps people achieve their dreams, help them edit their own pieces, give them the help they need to perfeect their art. Being exposed to thee digital world helped me find happiness in life, it made me find my purpose." <strong>BOLD</strong>
