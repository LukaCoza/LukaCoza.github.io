  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>I am an up and coming video artist. I thrive to create the best visually appealing images for movies I create with me and my friends. Some say it is difficult to work in the VFX world but I find it challenging. Having many tools at my disposal such as my friends, I have the ability to put my thoughts into pieces of art. I view myself as someone who wants to make their own dreams become a reality, however I wish I had someone to kick me in the back to help me stay motivated to do so. With every piece I create, I put my all into it. It is my goal to make people smile or say How did you do that?". I want to be the person who helps people achieve their dreams, help them edit their own pieces, give them the help they need to perfeect their art. Being exposed to thee digital world helped me find happiness in life, it made me find my purpose."
  <p>In order for me to express myself, I must have my own platform to display my visions as an artist living in the 21st century. Having my own website helps me remind myself of my own achievements and the direction I have taken. I love making short videos with just enough quality for it to be seen from a brauder audience. I have always loved adding a creative spin to my videos such as making people levetate on fire and bending videos to make the earth as small as a golf ball. I feel like my videos could be best used for commercials or other broadcasting uses. Using greenscreens and enogh editing tricks, creating videos such as these is a walk in the park. I hope to one day show the world my life through the internet using digital arts as a guide. To relate my struggles in life with the viewer.
